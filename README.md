Week 4 Challenge Homework - Pandas Challenge Repo for Week 4 Challenge submission - Chris Kilkes 3/1/24 @ 11:19 am PST What the project does: 1) PyCitySchools Analysis provides school district stakeholders with an in-depth analysis of their district's performance and its impact on helping their students achieve (or not) their academic goals. Why the project is useful: Informs the various school district stakeholders (administrators, parents, teachers, the public, students, etc.) with data analysis and highlights that can provide support for further investigation and remedies for overcoming some of the challenges highlighted in the analysis. How users can get started with the project: Download, run analysis and evaluate results for self. Resources used for building Pandas project include multiple sources such as: Pandas Cheat Sheet (https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandas-cheat-sheet/)in particular was very helpful to me, as was using the official Pandas documentation; instructor teaching (classes & shared resources), aid from fellow students, Google Search, StackOverflow, as well as support and guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT.
